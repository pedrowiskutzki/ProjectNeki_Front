# ðŸš€ React Login and Skills Management App

This is a React project that implements a login form, a user registration form, and a skills management page. It uses localStorage to store the user's preferences, and it communicates with a server-side API to perform the authentication and data management tasks.

## âœ¨ Features

âœ… Login page with username, password, and remember me checkbox.

âœ… User registration page with username, password, and confirmation fields.

âœ… Home page with a list of skills, each containing an image, a name, a level, and a description.

âœ… Skill edition and removal buttons in the skill list.

âœ… Skill creation modal dialog with a dropdown to select a skill.

âœ… Logout button.

## ðŸ’» Installation

To install this application, clone the repository and run the following commands:

npm install
npm start

Then open http://localhost:3000 to view it in the browser.

## ðŸŽ¬ Usage
To use this application, follow these steps:

1. Open the Login page and enter your username and password.
2. If you want the application to remember your credentials, check the Remember me checkbox.
3. Click the Login button. If your credentials are correct, you will be redirected to the Home page.
4. On the Home page, you can see the list of skills you have added.
5. To edit a skill's level or remove it, click the corresponding buttons in the skill's row.
6. To add a new skill, click the Add Skill button and select a skill from the dropdown list. Then click the Save button.
7. To logout, click the Logout button.

## ðŸ”’ Security

This application implements basic security measures to protect the user's data. It does not allow access to the Home page without a valid login, and it stores the user's credentials in localStorage only if the Remember me checkbox is checked. The application communicates with a server-side API to perform the authentication and data management tasks, and it uses HTTPS protocol to encrypt the data in transit. However, this application is not intended to be used in a production environment without further security enhancements.
